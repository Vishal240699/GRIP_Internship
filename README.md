# GRIP_Internship
I am doing an Internships at The Sparks Foundation
and this repository will be used to upload the tasks 
I will be doing this month.

I am planning to do this Internships in both the languages commonly used by the
Data Scientists, which are Python and R.
Well, I don't yet favour any of the language but this internship gave me an
oppurtunity to improve both my skills in Python and R
